# DH SAE | Technical Test case

I would like to start by saying I would have liked more context of the business model this case study represents and a data dictionary would have been awesome.

Also, without a question a stakeholder engagement is necessary to get the most out this case study.

**`qualified_customer_orders` materialized view**

The qualified_customer_orders materialized view provides a consolidated view of customer orders enriched with the latest customer contact details for each order. It includes information on the order's success or failure status, monetary details such as order value and discounts, and the most recent customer interaction date and reason. The table ensures uniqueness at the order_id level and supports advanced analytics on customer engagement and order outcomes.

Key Features:
  * Uniqueness guaranteed by order_id.
  * Latest customer contact date (last_contact_date) and reason (last_contact_reason) and no of contacts.
  * Comprehensive order metadata (brand, customer ID, value, status).

<br />

```sql

create materialized view dh-codapro-analytics-2460.hiring_search_analytics.qualified_customer_orders
as
with customer_orders_data as 
  (
    select 
      partition_date
    , placed_at_utc
    , order_id
    , brand
    , customer_id
    , order_value_eur
    , discount_value_eur
    , is_successful
    , voucher_value_eur
    , c.contact_at
    , c.reason
    , count(*) over(partition by order_id) as no_of_cs_contact 
    , row_number() over(partition by order_id order by case when c.reason = 'Post-Delivery' then 'AAAAA' else c.reason end) as rnk 
    from `dh-codapro-analytics-2460.hiring_search_analytics.customer_orders_data` , unnest(customer_contact) c
  )
select
  partition_date
, placed_at_utc
, order_id
, brand
, customer_id
, order_value_eur
, discount_value_eur
, is_successful
, voucher_value_eur
, no_of_cs_contact
, contact_at as last_contact_at
, reason as last_contact_reason
from customer_orders_data
where true
and rnk = 1
;
```
<br />

**`experiments` materialized view**

The experiments materialized view consolidates experiment-related data from the backend_logging_data table to support detailed analysis of user experiments. It extracts critical fields such as session, client IDs, and experiment details while cleaning and parsing the JSON payload for relevant attributes. The view allows analysts to efficiently track, query, and assess the impact of experiments across various dimensions like country, brand, and user types.

Key Points:
  * Experiment Tracking: Captures experiment identifiers, variations, and AB test status.
  * Session and Client: Tracks user activity using session_id and client_id.
  * Payload Cleaning: Removes the vendors field using JSON_REMOVE to simplify data structure.
    * this how we foucsed on relevent attributes for later extraction.
  * Field Parsing: Extracts important fields from `Payload` such as:
    * Country Code
    * Language Code
    * Brand (not sure why it's different from higher level Brand field!!)
    * Pro-customer flag

Purpose: Facilitates analysis of experiment performance by aggregating key metrics and dimensions.

    -- , (JSON_KEYS(payload_no_vendors, mode => "lax recursive")) as list_of_payload_keys
    from experiments
    ;
```
<br />

**`events` materialized view**

The events materialized view aggregates customer interaction data to facilitate tracking of user journeys, event progression, and transaction-related insights. It enhances event-level data with ordered classifications and aggregates event names to derive key insights, such as the furthest event reached and the total number of events per session.

Key Features:
  * List of Events (`list_of_events`): Ordered list of unique events in each session, reflecting the user's journey.
    * Assigns a numerical prefix (01., 02., etc.) to important events like `app.open`, `add_cart.click`, and `transaction` to facilitate ordering and analysis.
    * `ARRAY_AGG` to generate lists of distinct events, ordered by significance, and captures the maximum event reached.
  * Max Event Reached (`max_event_reached`): The last event reached in the session, useful for conversion funnel analysis.
  * Number of Events (`no_of_events`): Total count of events within a session, indicating engagement levels.
  * Designed to support analysis of user behaviors, session-level engagement, and event-based metrics, contributing to micro-conversion analysis and experiment tracking.

It's also worth mentioning that there are full record duplications `inÂ behavioural_customer_data` `121696` vs. `121451` unique record.

**Query 1: `assignments` materialized view**

The assignments materialized view integrates customer order data, behavioral events, and experimental results, enabling comprehensive analysis of customer interactions, order details, and experiment participation. This view helps track customer engagement, purchase behaviors, and experiment outcomes across various dimensions such as regions, devices, and session identifiers.

Key Features:
  * Merges order, event, and experiment data based on session and customer identifiers. 
  * Provides a consolidated view with key attributes: order success, device, experiment participation, and customer details.
